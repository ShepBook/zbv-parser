h1. zbv-parser - The simple Zetaback Violator report parser.

By Jared Koumentis

h2. What it does.

  * Takes input of a plain text file in the format of a Zetaback violator report.
  * Outputs only legit violators. (To allow you to focus on your work.)

h2. Why it exists.

  * In my work, I have to review Zetaback violator reports. These are used to ensure our backups are up to date.
  * Any backup that is "stale", that is older than 14 days, ends up in the report.
  * The objective is to allow you to use the report and determine what you should look at and ensure that your backups are working properly.
  * Unfortunately, the way it reports, it will not take into consideration that a Full backup is dependent on an Incremental that has not gone stale. However, it will still report the Full backup as "stale".
  * These false positives suck and make my job harder. So, this exists to trim out these false positives.

h2. How to use it.

  * Call the program like "$ ruby zbv-parser.rb ./zetaback-report"
  * It will then parse your log, finding actual violations, and output to your terminal with the actual violators.
  * Take care of the violators while enjoying the fact that you don't have to attempt to manually parse through all the false positives.

h2. Requirements.

  * Ruby ~> 1.9
